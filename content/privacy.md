### Our commitment to your privacy

Brainium Studios (“Brainium”, “we” or “our”), located in the United States, is a developer and publisher of games for mobile devices. We respect your privacy and we are committed to protecting your personal information in a variety of ways including using industry accepted security measures to protect against loss, misuse and alteration of data contained in our systems. This Privacy Notice is designed to describe how we collect, secure, maintain and share the personal information of users and visitors when collected on our websites or applications which link to this Privacy Notice.

### Scope of the Privacy Policy

This Privacy Notice covers the collection, use, storage and disclosure of your personal information collected when you visit a Brainium website (“Website”), when you order, download, and/or use our games and mobile applications (“Applications”), and any information shared with Brainium by its business partners (collectively “Services”).

Our Services may contain links to and portions of other websites or services. When you leave our Services or view a portion of a third party’s website or services through our Services, we encourage you to read the privacy statements of those websites or third-party service. Brainium is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of other websites or services.

Please review this Privacy Notice carefully before using our Services. If you do not want Brainum to collect, use, store or disclose your personal information as we have described in this Privacy Notice, you may not use our Website or Applications.

### Information Collection and Use

Brainium collects different types of information from you in order to provide you with the best products and user experience and to operate effectively. Some information is provided directly by you and some information may be gathered automatically, in particular by observing how you interact with our Services. Generally, we may receive your personal information in the following ways:

#### Information Provided Directly by You

When you register for an event we host, complete a form requesting information, send us a support enquiry, contact us for employment or otherwise participate in blogs and online communities we host, we receive your information in order to facilitate your request.

#### Information Provided by Third Parties at Your Request

When you download an Application, we may have access to certain information as permitted by the application store provider (such as the Apple App Store or Google Play). Generally, this information is only order related and includes an order number, game purchased and other related information. Where necessary, the application store provider may allow us to access certain other order related information for us to respond to a support enquiry. This is generally limited to an email address that you will have already provided to us so that we can respond to your support request. Accessing this data allows us to validate your purchase and respond to your particular request.

Your personal information may also be provided to Brainium when you (i) access the Services using a third-party social network (such as Facebook or Game Center), or (ii) where you otherwise use the Services and personal information is required for your use and/or participation. Note that by using a Brainium Application through a third party social network or other third party platform or service (a “Third Party Social Network”), or by connecting to a Third Party Social Network via an Application, you authorize us to collect, store and use any and all information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and you agree that such Third Party Social Network may provide us information based on your settings or preferences available on the Third Party Social Network.

#### Information Provided Indirectly

We also collect information from you indirectly when you use the Services. The information we collect automatically through our Services may include information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification number, browser-type, general geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) device serial number or MAC address, the open Unique Device Identifier (UDID) of the device and other related technical information.  We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our Website, including the pages accessed and links clicked.  Collecting this information enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our Website, where they come from, and what content on our Website is of interest to them.  We use this information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our Website to our visitors.

When using our Applications, our servers may automatically record certain information about your use of the application such as links and advertisements on our mobile applications that you clicked on, the amount of time you spent interacting with the Application and other statistical information. We aggregate this information across all users of our Applications and use this information to administer our Applications and improve and enhance the Applications by expanding features and functionality based upon our users’ needs and preferences.

Some of the information we collect when you use our Services may also be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further in our [Cookie Notice.](http://www.brainiumstudios.com/site/cookienotice.html)

We also receive your personal information from our analytics and advertising partners as indicated within this Privacy Notice.

#### How We Collect Information

Brainium gathers information about how you use our website, products and services in a number of ways, as indicated above, including:

- Through direct submission of information such as completion of a web-form when you register for an event we sponsor or when you request we contact you for feedback or support.
- Through technologies like cookies (please see our [Cookie Notice](http://www.brainiumstudios.com/site/cookienotice.html) for more information about this technology)
- Web logging, which enables us to collect the standard information your browser sends to every web site you visit such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the site you came from as well as pages you visit and links you click on within our website.
- For users of our Applications, we may use tools and other tracking software within our applications to collect information related to the areas within the application you have visited and links you click on.

#### How we Use Your Personal Information

We do not sell, rent, lease, trade or share your personal information with any third parties other than as described in this Privacy Notice. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with the Services you request. Your personal information will not be shared with a third party not affiliated with or owned by Brainium, except where we have your express permission, or when otherwise required by law. For example, Brainium may share your personal information with other companies or people when:

- We have your express consent to share the information
- We need to share your information to provide the Services you have requested, including sharing information with companies who work with Brainium to provide the Services to you
- We are legally required to respond to a subpoena, court order, or legal process or we find that your actions violate your agreement with Brainium or any of our usage guidelines for specific Services

When you provide us with your personal information or otherwise choose to sign up to receive email communications from us, we will use that information to send those communications to you. If you no longer wish to receive emails from us, you may "opt-out" within the emails we send or by emailing us at [privacy@BrainiumStudios.com](mailto:privacy@brainiumstudios.com) and indicating “Opt-Out” in the subject line.

Personal information of Application users, such as name, contact information, username and password is stored by our third party marketplace partners, like Apple and Google. Any information shared with us is kept secure and is used to assist you in accessing your account in accordance with our agreement with the relevant third party marketplace partner. We do not share this information outside Brainium other than as set forth in this Privacy Notice unless specifically authorized or required by law. We may share de-identified information in relation to your use of our Applications with trusted third parties to enable us to provide you with improved functionality and/or the requested Services.

We store Application use information collected through cookies and log files to create a profile of our users. Profile information enables us to improve your experience and to properly respond to support requests.

### Cookies and Other Tracking Technology

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts are used by Brainium and our tracking utility and ad delivery partners. These technologies are used to analyze trends, administer our Website, track users’ movements around our site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole in order to learn more about how users interact with our Services. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our tracking utility partners on an individual as well as aggregated basis. For more information about cookies, please see our [Cookie Notice](http://www.brainiumstudios.com/site/cookienotice.html).

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. This information is used to analyze use trends, to administer our Website, to track users’ movements around our Website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

In addition, Session Variables may be used temporarily in your system cache to create ease-of-use during your transaction with our site. Examples of such information are automatically-produced alphanumeric numbers held during your session on our site to facilitate page-to-page transactions.

Brainium and our third-party tracking utility and ad partners may also use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective and to manage and measure the performance of advertising. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” privacy preference. Generally, when a user turns on the Do Not Track Signal, their browser sends a message to websites requesting that the user not be tracked. Our Website and Applications currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals. However, you do have other options for opting out of tracking for interest-based advertising purposes as described in this Privacy Notice.

### Analytic Metrics and Other Technologies

Our Services may include third party tracking tools from our service providers, examples of which include Google Analytics and Flurry. Such third parties may use cookies, APIs, and/or SDKs in our Services to enable them to collect and analyze user information on our behalf. The third parties may have access to information such as your device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), geo-location information, and IP address. We use analytics information for supporting business analysis and operations, business intelligence, product development, improving products and services, personalizing content, providing advertising, and making recommendations. These third party tracking tools may also use a technology called conversion tracking. We use conversion tracking to judge the quality of the campaigns we are running to promote Brainium products. For example, you may see our mobile applications advertised in other services. After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing one of our Applications, conversion tracking allows us to verify the installation and the device identifier shared with the applicable third party advertiser. A non-exclusive list of analytics companies that operate these technologies on or through our Applications can be found by going [here](http://www.brainiumstudios.com/site/thirdparty.html). By downloading and using our Applications, you agree that these analytics companies may collect and use data and information in accordance with the privacy Notice for that company.

### Ad Serving Technology

Some of our Applications, particularly our no-cost Applications, may feature advertising. The advertisers may collect and use information about you, such as your session activity, device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, geo-location information and IP address. This information may be used to provide advertisements of interest to you. Interest-based ads are helpful because they are more likely to be tailored to your particular interests. They are also more likely to help you discover new services that are actually relevant to you and your interests. Also, if interest-based tracking is enabled, you likely will not see the same ads over and over because the number of times you see a particular interest-based ad is usually limited. By opting-out of interest-based ads, you lose all of these benefits.

By using the no-cost Application you agree that such third-party advertisers may collect and use data and information in accordance with the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology. Links to the relevant privacy policies from the ad serving companies that operate their own networks on our Services are provided [here](http://www.brainiumstudios.com/site/thirdparty.html). Brainium is not responsible for the information practices of advertisers and partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by advertisers and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this Privacy Notice. If you do not want to have your information shared with these advertisers, do not use our Services.

### Children under 16

Our Services are not directed to children under 16 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 16. If we learn that we have collected personal information of an individual under 16 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.

### Social Media Features and Widgets

Our Services include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and Widgets, such as the “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Services. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a Cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website or within the Services. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy Notice of the company providing it.

### Special Notice for Users and Visitors from the European Union, United Kingdom or Switzerland

We want you to know that individuals from the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland have certain rights associated with their personal information based on applicable law.

### Business Transitions
