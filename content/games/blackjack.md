**Blackjack Rules**: Blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the most popular casino games in the world. Blackjack is a card game where players compete against the dealer. The object of the game is to reach 21 or to reach a score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21. In Blackjack by Brainium, the dealer must draw to 16 and stand on soft 17. Blackjack pays 3 to 2, and insurance pays 2 to 1.

**Odds of Winning Blackjack**: Like all casino games, the odds of winning are slightly in favor of the casino. In our game, we use a cryptographically strong randomizer to shuffle the decks to make the game as authentic as possible. The game of blackjack is not meant to be “won” but it’s a game of both strategy and chance resulting in both wins and losses. The unfavorable hands make the following winning streaks that much sweeter.
