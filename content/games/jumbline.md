Jumbline 2 by Brainium is easily the most addictive word game in the App Store. The object of the game is to make words from jumbled lines of letters. Rearrange the scrambled letters into words, and underline them with your finger to score points; find the largest possible word and advance to the next level. Play in a relaxing un-timed mode, or put your skills up against the clock in timed rounds.

Includes 2 FREE additional games: Cloud Pop and Star Tower. In Cloud Pop, your goal is to pop as many clouds as possible, by spelling words out of the letters carried in each cloud. In Star Tower, your task is to build the tallest tower you can, before it sinks into the ground, by making and staking words out of an infinitely jumbled line of letters. The larger the word, the slower your tower sinks, so think fast, think big, and save that tower!

Jumbline 2 is ideal for fans of Scrabble, Words With Friends, TextTwist, TextTwist Turbo, Text Twist 2, Word Mix, and Syrious Scramble. Play with friends and family cooperatively, or fly solo.
