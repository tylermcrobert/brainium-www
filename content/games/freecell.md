Freecell by Brainium stays true to the classic spirit of the Freecell Solitaire, but updates it with an elegant, easy to use interface.

The goal of Freecell is to build up the four foundations in ascending suit sequence from Ace to King with cards of the identical suit. If you're rusty on the rules, our animated tutorial will show you the way and get you back to playing in no time.
