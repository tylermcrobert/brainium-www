ilu is a puzzle game solved with light.

In the boundless void of space, countless forgotten worlds drift in the dark. Long ago, these desolate planets lost their star mothers & with them the ability to warm their dark & frozen features. It is your mission to bring light & life to these abandoned landscapes.

You are an intergalactic explorer that can create fertile ecosystems by solving puzzles with globes of terraforming light. Puzzles are solved by filling the game board with this light. Once the game board is fully illuminated, an explosion of beautifully animated alien plants burst to life. When all of the puzzles on a planet are solved, a chain reaction of life transforms the entire world into a lush oasis.
